// Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

// The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
// The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
// The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
// See more examples in "Sample Tests:"
// Notes
// Not all paths can be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other and can't become such. Hence the result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].

function dirReduc(arr){
  // ...
  let answer = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] == 'SOUTH' && answer[i - 1] != 'NORTH')
  }
}
